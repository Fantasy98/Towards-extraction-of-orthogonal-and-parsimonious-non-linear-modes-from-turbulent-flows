# Towards extraction of orthogonal and parsimonious non-linear modes from turbulent flows

## Introduction
The code in this repository features a Python implemention of $\beta$-variational autoencoders $\beta$-VAEs based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to decompose and reconstruct $x-z$ cross-sectional streamwise velocity fluctuation component fields at $y/h = 0.5$.
