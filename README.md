# Towards extraction of orthogonal and parsimonious non-linear modes from turbulent flows

## Introduction
The code in this repository features a Python implemention of $\beta$-variational autoencoders $\beta$-VAEs based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to decompose and reconstruct the urban flow fields generated through well-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES) using the open-source numerical code Nek5000. Input data are instanteous fields of streamwise velocity fluctuation component. More details about the implementation and results from the training are available in ["Towards extraction of orthogonal and parsimonious non-linear modes from turbulent flows", Hamidreza Eivazi, Soledad Le Clainche, Sergio Hoyas, Ricardo Vinuesa](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117038)
